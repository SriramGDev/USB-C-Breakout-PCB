# USB-C-Breakout-PCB
A simple USB-C breakout board meant to be used with mechanical keyboard PCBs. This DOES NOT use a JST connector, but rather a Molex one. It also does not use the standard Hirose Type-C port (which is prone to snapping off boards) but rather a more secure though more expensive hybrid SMT/THT Wurth port. See the BOM for more details.
